	<h2 id="p1">Choir</h2>
	<p>A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures.</p>
	
	<h2 id="p2">Sport Club</h2>
	<p>Sports clubs range from organisations whose members play together, unpaid, and may play other similar clubs on occasion, watched mostly by family and friends, to large commercial organisations with professional players which have teams which regularly compete against those of other clubs and attract sometimes very large crowds of paying spectators. Clubs may be dedicated to a single sport or to several (multi-sport club).</p>
	<h2 id="p3">Tabble tennis</h2>
	<p>Table tennis or ping-pong is a game played on a flat table divided by a net. Two or four players hit a light ball using a round bat across the table. The ball should only bounce once on one side of the table before the players hit it back to the other side. Players increase their scores when their opponents fail to return the ball immediately after it hits their side once.</p>

	<h1>Hobbies</h1>
	<ul style="list-style: square">
	<h2 id="p4">Basketball</h2>
	 <p>I got involved in basketball because I was interested in the sport and I started playing it everyday from when I was a kid, also I got into my school basketball teams. Basketball is very enjoyable to play when you get to know the rules and all, that is why I am interested in the sport. I am currently  playing it everyday after school and in school with my friends, I have improved enormously from a year ago.</p>
<h2 id="p5">Listening to music</h2>
	<p> I enjoy music and I listen to it every single day. There are a lot of different styles of music for you to choose and enjoy. If I am in a good mood, I prefer to listen to some energy rock music that keeps me happy and full of power. If I am tired, I choose some calm, relaxing songs. Music can speak, through music people can express feelings and emotions. When you hear something that looks like you, that you understand it easily, you start to love it. There are several different ways to enjoy music as your hobby. </p>
	<h2 id="p6">Dancing</h2>
	<p> Dancing is an enjoyable activity and whenever you feel bored in your daily routines then you should spend some time learning dance like Zumba, Ballet, Hip Hop or Belly dance. In starting the dance classes may look a bit intimidating to you but in general they are not. To learn dance all you have to do is have strong determination and good practice. Besides, once you enroll in the dance classes, you will realize the decrease in your stress level.</p>
